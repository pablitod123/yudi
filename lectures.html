                                <p>Professor Barberis’ research focuses on behavioral finance—in particular, on applications of cognitive
                                psychology to understanding investor trading behavior and the pricing of financial assets. He has published
                                extensively in the top economics and finance journals, gives frequent presentations about his work to both
                                academic and non-academic audiences, and has won numerous awards for both research and teaching. Prior to
                                coming to Yale, Professor Barberis taught at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. </p>
